## How to Run
To run any of these projects, follow these general steps:
### 1. Clone the Repository:

  ```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
  ```
### 2. Compile and Execute:
Each project typically includes a 'README.md' file with specific instructions on how to compile and run the program. Navigate to the projectdirectory and follow the instructions provided in the README.md file.
Replace repository-name with the actual repository name and executable_name with the name of the compiled executable specific to each project.

### 3. General Steps:

- Navigate to the project directory.

- Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).

- Execute the compiled executable.

### Example:

 ```sh
cd attendance-monitoring-system
gcc main.c -o attendance
./attendance
 ```
Replace repository-name with the actual repository name for each project.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC). Some projects may require additional libraries or software, which will be specified in their respective folders.

## How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? <img alt="GIF" src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/hmm.gif" width="20" />

1. Go [**`here`**](https://github.com/ShravanDalavi/C_ProgrammingProjects) and click the big green ‚ûû  **`Code`** button in the top right of the page, then click ‚ûû [**`Download ZIP`**](https://github.com/shravandalavi/C_ProgrammingProjects/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

2. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.    
3. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them
  
    **`Kernel > Restart & Clear Output`**
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.
<br>
If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to pull with git and run ipython notebook again.
